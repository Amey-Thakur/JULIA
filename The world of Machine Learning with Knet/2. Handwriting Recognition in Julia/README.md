# Knet Tutorial

This tutorial introduces the programming language Julia and the Knet deep learning
framework. By the end, the reader should be able to define, train, evaluate, and visualize
basic MLP, CNN, and RNN models.  Each notebook is written to work stand-alone but they rely
on concepts introduced in earlier notebooks, so I recommend reading them in order. Every
Knet function outside of the standard Julia library is defined or explained before use.

To run the notebooks on your computer, install and run IJulia by typing the following at the
`julia>` prompt (see [IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) for more
information):

```julia-repl
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("IJulia"); Pkg.add("Knet")
julia> using IJulia, Knet
julia> notebook(dir=Knet.dir("tutorial"))
```

To run the notebooks in the cloud you can use [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb), or services like
[AWS](http://aws.amazon.com). To run on Colab copy the notebooks to the "Colab Notebooks"
folder in your Google Drive, then open and follow the instructions in the
[JuliaOnColab.ipynb](JuliaOnColab.ipynb) notebook.  To run on AWS follow the instructions in
the [Knet Installation
Section](http://denizyuret.github.io/Knet.jl/latest/install.html#Using-Amazon-AWS-1).
