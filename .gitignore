# Manifest files (often ignored for libraries, but could be relevant for applications)
# Manifest.toml is often kept for exact reproducibility, but basic gitignore ignores it sometimes.
# I will NOT ignore Manifest.toml here as it is often critical for reproducibility in learning repos.
# However, I will ignore generated files.
