        "[Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) does not provide native support for the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org). However, since Colaboratory gives you root access to the machine that runs your notebook (the *“runtime”* in Colaboratory terminology), we can install Julia support by uploading a specially crafted Julia notebook  – *this* notebook. We then install Julia and [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) ([Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)/Colaboratory notebook support) and reload the notebook so that Colaboratory detects and initiates what we installed.\n",

        "This hack by Pontus Stenetorp is an adaptation of [James Bradbury’s original Colaboratory Julia hack](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-on-google-colab-free-gpu-accelerated-shareable-notebooks/15319/27), that broke some time in September 2019 as Colaboratory increased their level of notebook runtime isolation. There also appears to be CUDA compilation support installed by default for each notebook runtime type in October 2019, which shaves off a good 15 minutes or so from the original hack’s installation time. Adapted for Knet by Deniz Yuret."
